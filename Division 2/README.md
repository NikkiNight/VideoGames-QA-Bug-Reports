# Division2-QA-Bug-Reports
This repo documents various bugs, localization errors, and gameplay inconsistencies I have discovered in *Tom Clancy's The Division 2* during regular play.

I'm a narrative and gameplay-focused player with a strong eye for detail, and this project reflects my ability to identify issues, write clear reports, and suggest actionable fixes.

All reports include bug type, affected feature, reproduction steps (if possible), and why the issue matters from a player and QA standpoint.
