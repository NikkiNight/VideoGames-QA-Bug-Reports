# OnceHuman-QA-Bug-Reports
This folder documents various bugs, localization errors, and gameplay inconsistencies I have discovered in *Once Human* during regular play.

These bugs were reported by me during the in-game event: Bug Hunt and ackowledged by the developers and fairly compensated.

All reports include bug type, affected feature, reproduction steps (if possible), and why the issue matters from a player and QA standpoint.
