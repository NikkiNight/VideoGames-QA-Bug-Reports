## Why is this issue important?
- From a player standpoint, it's frustrating when following the commendations instructions and not receive the intended result. This leads to confusion, wasted effort, and a diminished sense of reward. This may prompt the player to take unnecesary steps to resolve the issue.
- From a QA standpoint, it refelects inconsistencies in faction tagging, or backend tracking. This can lead to reduced player engagement and generate avoidable support tickets and negative feedback.
